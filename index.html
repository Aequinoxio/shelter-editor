<p>Dear Website Owner:</p>
<p>ZeniMax Media Inc. and/or its affiliates (collectively, &ldquo;<strong><em>ZeniMax</em></strong>&rdquo;) is the owner of some of the most famous trademarks in the video game industry, including The Elder Scrolls&reg;, Fallout&reg;, DOOM&reg; and The Evil Within&reg; trademarks. These trademarks are used to identify, advertise, and promote ZeniMax&rsquo;s products and activities. They are protected around the world under U.S. and international trademark law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are using ZeniMax trademark(s) as a meta tag, keyword, media, or other visible or concealed text in connection with your website located at github.io. By doing so, you intentionally seek to attract Internet users to your website. This unauthorized use of ZeniMax&rsquo;s intellectual property falsely suggests ZeniMax&rsquo;s sponsorship or endorsement of your website. This practice infringes on ZeniMax&rsquo;s exclusive intellectual property rights. It also constitutes a violation of the game's Terms of Service.</p>
<p>We demand you immediately remove all ZeniMax trademarks from meta tags, keywords, media, and other visible or concealed text that are connected to your website located at https://rakion99.github.io/shelter-editor/<br /><a href="http://robot9706.github.io/FSSE/">http://robot9706.github.io/FSSE/</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>&lt;---- (LOL this is not mine lmao)</strong></p>
<p>Further legal action may be pursued if this situation is not immediately resolved.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>ZeniMax Media Inc.</p>
